    <h2>Digital versus film, which is better?</h2>
    <h3>This question leads to a never ending debate by photographers everywhere.</h3>
      <p>Both have their pros and cons, but it cannot be helped that digital is the preferred way of taking pictures.
        The reason being because it is more accessible and familiar to beginning photographers.
        Most, if not everyone has a camera on their mobile phone and some beginning photographers start with smartphone digital photography,
        therefore transitioning to a “real” camera is not as overwhelming as a completely different device such as a film camera.</p>
        <h3>Cost: Which will give you the bang for your buck?</h3>
        <p>First things first, you will need a camera to take photos.
        And purchasing a DSLR (digital single-lens reflex) camera will most likely be one of the more costly expenses.
        Unless, you want to purchase more lenses for your camera and those can vary in price depending on the lens.
        Plus, all your photos are stored digitally in an SD card and those are relatively inexpensive and can be reused.
        While a film camera would be more inexpensive to enter into the photography world, there is still the need to purchase film.
        Film has a limited amount of shots or exposures you can take, so once you would finish the roll or sheets of film you would need to purchase more.
        Film then needs to be developed in a darkroom in order to get the prints of your photos.
        Which usually means that you would have to send your film off to someone else to get it developed and printed.
        That is if you do not have access to one yourself. Plus, there is a risk of having your film exposed to sunlight,
        which could ruin the film, if you were to send it off to someone who could develop the film. But in that case, just make sure it is well protected.</p>
    <h3>Quality: Which camera takes better photos?</h3>
      <p>There is always a preference when it comes to which is better.
        Many photographers enjoy film because it is better at capturing subtle details that are lost in digital photography and captures photos in higher resolution than most digital cameras.
         Plus, you can get away with minor focusing and exposure issues.
         With digital you have the advantage of being able to see your photo immediately after you have taken it.
         With film it could take weeks before you are able to see the photos. And you can take many more photos with a  DSLR without as much consequence as a film camera.
        Plus, there is ease of access to edit photos by transferring them over from the SD card to a computer.</p>
