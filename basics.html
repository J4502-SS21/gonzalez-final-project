  <h2>Basics every photographer should know about a camera</h2>
  <h3>We start with how a camera takes photos.
    Learning the mechanisms to a camera can possibly increase your understanding to improve your photographs and skills.</h3>
    <p>The process of how a film captures an image lies in visible light. Film is made of plastic and silver grains.
      These silver grains, when exposed to light (when the shutter opens) darken, creating what are known as negatives of images.
      Negatives are inversions of color or black and white depending on the type of film you are using.
      So, if you take a photo outside when the sun is shining the negative will be dark and vice versa if you take a picture at night, the negative will come out light.  (as seenâ€¦)
      Digital cameras function in a similar way to film cameras.
      The biggest difference is instead of the light making film react.
      The light or rather what you are seeing through the viewfinder is hitting an electronic sensor in the camera which breaks up the image into pixels.
      The sensor is measuring the color and brightness of each pixel and turning it into numbers.
      These numbers contain the details of each pixel it contains, making up the entire photo.</p>
