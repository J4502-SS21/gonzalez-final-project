    <h2>Digital versus film, which is better?</h2>
    <h3>This question leads to a never ending debate by photographers everywhere.</h3>
      <p>Both have their pros and cons, but it cannot be helped that digital is the preferred way of taking photos. Most, if not everyone has a camera on their mobile phone.
        And some beginning photographers start with smartphone digital photography or others begin with a “real” camera.
         The reason being because it is more accessible and familiar to beginning photographers. Plus, these cameras tend to do a lot of the work for you.
          And when one thinks of what kind of camera a photographer has it looks like the photo on the right.
          Now, I’m not stating that digital is better, if anything, let me explain below.</p>

        <h3>Cost: Which will give you the bang for your buck?</h3>
        <p>First things first, you will need a camera to take photos. And purchasing a DSLR (digital single-lens reflex) camera will most likely be one of the more costly expenses.
           Unless, you would like to purchase more lenses for your camera and those can vary in price depending on the lens.
           Plus, all your photos are stored digitally in an SD card and those are relatively inexpensive and can be reused.
           <br>A film camera on the other hand, would cost significantly less  to enter into the photography world. But there is still the need to purchase film.
           Film has a limited amount of shots or exposures you can take, so once you would finish the roll or sheets of film you would need to purchase more.
           The process of obtaining photos means the film then needs to be developed in a darkroom in order to get the prints of your photos.
           That usually means that you would have to ship your film off to someone else to get it developed and printed.
           Because these days there are not many physical stores that develop film. That is if you do not have access to a darkroom  yourself.
           Although, there is a risk of having your film exposed to light (which could ruin the film depending on how long it was exposed) if you were to send it off to someone who could develop the film.
           But in that case, just make sure it is well protected.</p>

    <h3>Quality: Which camera takes better photos?</h3>
      <p>There is always a preference when it comes to which is better.
        Many photographers enjoy film because it is better at capturing subtle details that are lost in digital photography.
        And captures photos in higher resolution than most digital cameras. Plus, you can get away with minor focusing and exposure issues.
        The largest benefit of working with film is slowing down the process of taking a photo. With film you have to think about what is going into your frame.
        You start rendering the world differently because you start to notice more and take more time attempting to get the ‘perfect shot’.
        And why wouldn’t you? Your film is limited and you paid good money for it, so why not make every picture count?
      <br> Additionally, your understanding of the relationship between ISO, shutter speed and aperture will increase.
        Allowing you to have a more knowledgable background about how to create a photo ad add it to your skills as a photographer.
        <br>With digital you have the advantage of being able to see your photo immediately after you have taken it.
        With film it could take weeks before you are able to see the photos. And you can take many more photos with a DSLR without as much consequence as a film camera.
        Plus, there is ease of access to edit photos by transferring them over from the SD card to a computer.
        But quality differs with digital cameras because of the size of the sensors, depth of field, and suffer from low light image capture.
        Overall, the way to think about which camera to purchase would be to first, look at your budget and see what you can afford.
        Second, would be to think if you would like to explore film or digital.
        Starting with either camera has its benefits and downfalls,
        but eventually as you grow as a photographer I personally think it would be in your best interest to go into the medium you did not begin with.</p>
